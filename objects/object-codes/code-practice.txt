1) How do you create an object with keys name as "kumar" and age as 25?
let person ={
    name:'kumar',
    age:25
}
console.log(person)

output:
{ name: 'kumar', age: 25 }

2) How do you access the value of name using dot notation and bracket notation?
let person ={
    name:'kumar',
    age:25
}
console.log(person.name) // dot notation
console.log(person['name'])// square bracket notation

output:
kumar
kumar

3) How do you add a new property city with value "Chennai" to this object?
let person ={
    name:'kumar',
    age:25,
}
person.city='Chennai';
console.log(person)

output:
{ name: 'kumar', age: 25, city: 'Chennai' }

4) How do you delete the age property from the object person?
let person ={
    name:'kumar',
    age:25,
}
delete person.age
console.log(person)

output:
{ name: 'kumar' }

5) How do you loop over all keys of the object person using for...in?

let person = {
    name:'kumar',
    age:23,
    city:'cbe',
    gender:'male'
}
for(key in person){
    console.log(key)
}

output:
name
age
city
gender

6) How do you loop over all values of the object person using for...in?
let person = {
    name:'kumar',
    age:23,
    city:'cbe',
    gender:'male'
}
for(value in person){
    console.log(person[value]);
}

output:
kumar
23
cbe
male

7) //How do you check if a property age exists in the object person?
let person = {
    name:'kumar',
    age:23,
    city:'cbe',
    gender:'male'
}
//console.log('age' in person)
if('age' in person){
    console.log('age property exists');
}
else{
    console.log('age property not exists');
}

output:
age property exists

8) //How do you merge two objects:

let obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
let obj2 = { c: 3, d: 4 };

console.log({...obj1, ...obj2}) // it cannot change any existing object
console.log(Object.assign(obj1,obj2)) //assign changed existing first object
console.log(obj1)
console.log(obj2)
output:
{ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }
{ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }
{ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }
{ c: 3, d: 4 }

9) Whatâ€™s the difference between dot notation and bracket notation when accessing object properties?
dot notation and bracket notation both are used to get the specific key. difference between these two is dot notation does not support space and special characters and
[] notation support space and special character and used in dynamic key values

10) What will this output?
let person = { name: "Alex", age: 25 };
for (let key in person) {
  console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
}

output:
name : Alex
age : 25

11) What will this output?

let person = { name: "Alex", age: 25 };
person["full name"] = "Alex Kumar";
console.log(person);

output:
{ name: 'Alex', age: 25, 'full name': 'Alex Kumar' }

12) How do you freeze an object so that no properties can be added, deleted, or changed?
let person = { name: "Alex", age: 25 };
person["full name"] = "Alex Kumar";

Object.freeze(person)
person.city='cbe' //unable to update,add,delete key and value in freezed property
console.log(person);
output:
unable to update key and value in freezed property

13) How do you get all keys and all values of an object using built-in methods?
let person ={
    name:'kumar',
    age:25
}
console.log(Object.keys(person)) // print only keys as array
console.log(Object.values(person)) //print only values as array
console.log(Object.entries(person)) //print key and value as array

output:
[ 'name', 'age' ]
[ 'kumar', 25 ]
[ [ 'name', 'kumar' ], [ 'age', 25 ] ]
